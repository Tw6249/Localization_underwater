# Localization_underwater

## Backgroud
This is the project about underwater sensor networks localization. And it's just for my personal research.

## Usage
The project includes 3 main scripts:
1. main_localizaiton_final_result: Final results of the whole localizaiton algorithm.
2. RSE_var_relationship: Studying the relationship between the number of nodes or density of the nodes and communicaiton range and the localization effects.
3. Test the properties of the Euclidean distance matrix.
